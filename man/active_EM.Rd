\arguments{
\item{docs}{[matrix]     Matrix of labeled and unlabeled documents, where each
row has index values and a nested Matrix of word tokens.}

\item{labels}{[vector]     Vector of character strings indicating classification
options for labeling.}

\item{docName}{[character]  Character string indicating the variable in 'docs'
that denotes the text of the documents to be classified.}

\item{indexName}{[character]  Character string indicating the variable in 'docs'
that denotes the index value of the document to be classified.}

\item{labelsName}{[character]  Character string indicating the variable in \code{docs}
that denotes the already known labels of the documents.
By default, value is set to \code{NULL}.}

\item{weight}{[numeric]    Numeric value between 0 and 1. Used to weight unlabeled
documents.}

\item{n_class}{[numeric]    Number of classes to be considered.}

\item{initIndex}{[vector]     Vector that indicates which documents to use to initialize the
algorithm. By default set to \code{NULL}, which causes a random
subset of the documents to be selected.}

\item{handLabel}{[logical]    Boolean logical value indicating whether to initiate user-input script.
If set to \code{FALSE}, and if \code{labelsName} is provided, the script
queries the document label directly from the column denoted by \code{labelsName}.}

\item{bound}{[numeric]    Minimum bound of entropy to call for additional labelling.}

\item{maxActive}{[numeric]    Value of maximum allowed active learning iterations.}

\item{initSize}{[numeric]    Value of maximum allowed iterations within the EM algorithm.}

\item{maxQuery}{[numeric]    Maximum number of documents queried in each EM iteration.}

\item{lazy_eval}{[logical]    If \code{lazy_eval == T}, convergence is measured by comparing changes
in log likelihood across model iterations rather than directly computing
maximand.}

\item{forceList}{[logical]    Switch indicating whether to force the filtering of documents with
no entropy. Set to \code{FALSE} by default.}

\item{counter_on}{[logical]    Switch indicating whether the progress of each sequence of the EM algorithm
is reported. By default set to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{queryType}{[string]     String indicating which type of uncertainty sampling to use. Options are \code{"standard_entropy"}
or \code{"normalized_entropy"}, \code{"tiered_entropy"}, or \code{"tiered_entropy_weighted"}.}

\item{whichOutTest}{[vector]     Vector of document index labels used to identify documents to be used for
out of sample validation of the learned model. Set to \code{NULL} by default.
If a vector of labels is provided, the function outputs an additional argument
containing classification likelihoods for all documents identified by the vector.}

\item{seed}{[numeric]    Sets seed for model.}

\item{fixed_words}{[matrix]     Matrix of fixed words with class probabilities, where ncol is the number of classes.}

\item{dfm}{[matrix]     Option to manually supply a dfm from quanteda.}

\item{exportAll}{[logical]    Switch indicating whether to export model predictions from each stage of the algorithm.
If true, the function exports a list of lists containing all predictions.}

\item{log_ratio_threshold}{[numeric] Threshold at which convergence is declared when using `queryType="log_ratio"`.}

\item{log_ratio_conv_type}{[string] If `queryType="log_ratio"`, this supplies the way that convergence is estimated.
Set to `maximand` by default.}

\item{mu}{Parameters for error acceptance with `queryType=log_ratio`.}

\item{tau}{Parameters for error acceptaance with `queryType=log_ratio`.}

\item{regions}{[string]     Can be set to "both", "pos", or "neg" to sample from certain regions during log ratio sampling.}

\item{lambda_decay}{[logical]    Determines whether lambda value decays over active learning iterations or not.}

\item{ld_rate}{[float]      If `lambda_decay == TRUE`, sets the rate at which decay occurs.}

\item{tune_lambda}{[logical]    Logical value indictating whether to tune lambda values with cross validation over
active learning iterations.}

\item{tune_lambda_prop_init}{[numeric] Float value indicating the proportion of documents to label supply
rather than label with EM during lambda tuning.}

\item{tune_lambda_range}{[vector] Vector of float values, indicating the range of lambda values to search
over when tuning lambda at each active iteration.}

\item{tune_lambda_k}{[integer] Integer value indicating what k-fold level to cross validate at when
tuning lambda.}

\item{NB_init}{[boolean] Indicates whether each active iteration should start with a naive step in the EM
or whether to initialize with model predictions from previous active iteration.}

\item{export_val_stats_only}{Boolean, indicating whether to export validation stats only from model runs.}

\item{model_name}{[string] Model name string for exporting when `export_val_stats_only == TRUE`.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters to pass to `get_dfm` and `EM()` and `get_uncertain_docs()`.}

\item{quantileBreaks}{[vector]   Vector of break points to distinguish entropy zones. The first value is
the break point between the first and second tier, the second is the
break point between the second and third tier.}

\item{sampleProps}{[vector]   Vector of sampling proportions for each entropy zone. The first value is
the proportion of \code{maxQuery} to be sampled from the high entropy region,
the second value is the proportion to be sampled from the middle entropy region,
and the third value is the proportion to be sampled from the lowest entropy region.}

\item{supervise}{[logical]    T if supervised. F is unsupervised.}

\value{
[list]       List containing labeled document matrix, prior weights, word likelihoods, and a vector
                                 of user-labeled documents ids.

\description{
Active learning for weighted-EM algorithm. After initial EM algorithm converges,
              oracle is queried for labels to documents that the EM algorithm was most unsure of.
              This process iterates until max iterations are reached, or there are no
              documents in the window of uncertainty.
